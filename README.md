# Advent of Code 23, in Scala

## Day 1

- Themes : numbers and regexp style, parsing
- First part difficulty : 1 / 4
- Second part difficulty : 3 / 4
- First part interest : 4 / 4
- Secon part interest : 2 / 4
- Comments : The first part was interesting and very in the style of the Advent of Code. The second one was - IMO - badly explained and took me longer than expected because of this. For instance `3twone` is supposed to yield `31`, which is not so clear when looking at the problem description.

## Day 2

- Themes : constructors / deconstructors, parsing, OOP model
- First part difficulty : 2 / 4
- Second part difficulty : 1 / 4
- First part interest : 3 / 4
- Second part interest : 2 / 4
- Comments : The most interesting part today was how to build a salient data model for handling the questions. This was interested and not too complicated.
